# Tic-Tac-Toe using Minmax Algorithm:-
I have implemented the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm, which is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. The Minimax algorithm ensures that the computer never loses a game if it plays perfectly.
